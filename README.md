Starling Renderer Plus
====================

Starling deferred shading and post-fx extension for Starling
------------------------------------------------------------

This project is intended to remove the need to have separate Starling fork for my <a href="https://github.com/Varnius/Starling-Framework">Starling deferred renderer</a> extension, thus making it a standalone extension which should work with official releases of Starling.

For the time being, this project should be included along with the fork as some code still lies over there.

Library contents:
-----------------

* Deferred renderer
* Pixel-perfect 2D shadow renderer
* Post FX renderer, currently contains following effects:
 * Bloom
 * Anamorphic Flares
